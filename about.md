## Welcome to NC Clear Path! 

We're a team of open-data advocates across North Carolina dedicated to improving mapping and trip planning services for those with limited mobility. We work with open source projects and open map data to create solutions for safe pedestrian paths. 

In America, 54.5 million people--or 1 in 6 Americans--require assistive devices or have trouble walking more than a quarter of a mile. These people face daily navigation challenges that are only made worse by applications like Google Maps that do not contain complete sidewalk data and do not consider such obstacles as missing curb cuts, broken sidewalks, or overly steep paths. 

## Want to help?

If you're interested in helping out, you can contact us via email at nc_clear_path@googlegroups.com, or you can reach out to the team on the [Open NC Slack channel](http://code-for-nc-slack-invitations.herokuapp.com/), which is part of Code for America.
