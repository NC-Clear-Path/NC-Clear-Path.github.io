# Announcing our first mapathon

We have our first sidewalk mapathon on the books! NC Clear Path will be the speaker at [Code for Durham](https://www.meetup.com/Triangle-Code-for-America/events/jrhtlpyxnbnc/) tomorrow night. We'd love to see you there!

## Code for Durham Mapathon

Come join us for a mapathon night!

NC Clear Path will provide training on how to map sidewalks - NO coding or mapping experience required! Just bring yourself, your laptop, and an external mouse if you have one.

We'll learn 
 - why Google Maps is frustrating for people with limited mobility, 
 - the open source solutions to this problem, and
 - how we can all help people navigate our cities more easily.
